      Anya is a charming and somewhat mischievous child with her straightforward remarks. She demonstrated her abilities to Loid Forger,
       who then decided to adopt her and create a makeshift family. Anya adapted quickly due to her ability to read people's minds, 
       which helped her understand the situations around her. Despite the short time, she loves her newly formed family. Additionally, 
       she takes pride in her abilities,
        as shown when she proudly displayed the Stella Star on her school uniform for everyone to see.
